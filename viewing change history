# Looking at the above output shows us more information.
# First we see changes in the filesystem on the switch as the size of the configuration file grows, or shrinks,
# as we change the configuration.
# Then at the bottom we see what was actually changed.
# In this case the line “host-name virt” was added since the last rancid-run.
# It’s possible to exclude part of the output from RANCID if you aren’t interested to changes made to the filesystem.
