# The BIRD Internet Routing Daemon
The BIRD project aims to develop a fully functional dynamic IP routing daemon primarily targeted on (but not limited to) Linux, FreeBSD and other UNIX-like systems  
BIRD supports Internet Protocol version 4 and version 6 by running separate daemons. It establishes multiple routing tables, and uses BGP, RIP, and OSPF routing protocols, as well as statically defined routes.
