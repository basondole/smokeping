# Configuration

If you want to change the ntp pools and server used to synchronize time, edit the ntp configuration file `/etc/ntp.conf`  

Below is the configuration on my server where I have specified the pool to use from ntp.pool.org also I have directed the server to use its local time as the source instead of the time from the pools. I have configured the allowed clients from 10.10.1.0/24  finally I have configured the ntp keys that clients will use to verify the association with this server using key 1 which is an md5 (M) key workbook. Keys are stored on a different file `/etc/ntp.keys`  

`root@eve-ng:~# cat /etc/ntp.conf`

```
restrict -4 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery limited
restrict -6 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery limited
restrict 127.0.0.1
restrict ::1
restrict source notrap nomodify noquery
restrict 10.10.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap

server 0.africa.pool.ntp.org
server 1.africa.pool.ntp.org
server 2.africa.pool.ntp.org
server 3.africa.pool.ntp.org
# local clock
server 127.127.1.0 prefer
fudge  127.127.1.0

driftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift
keys /etc/ntp.keys
trustedkey 1
```  

Edit the keys file to add the keys

`root@eve-ng:~# cat /etc/ntp.keys`  
`1 M workbook`

After configuration changes restart the service  
`sudo service ntp restart`
