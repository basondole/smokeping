# Rancid Groups
After installing RANCID you have to configure the list of groups you will use.
A group is a collection of network devices. When a change is made to a device an email will be sent notifying the group admins.  
Another way to use groups aside from separating the change notifications is that RANCID will store all device configurations from a group in a separate directory.  
The groups are setup in the /etc/rancid/rancid.conf file
In this example we'll setup the groups "core" and "access" by editing the /etc/rancid/rancid.conf file:

### Add the groups groups
 
**baggy@plasma:~$**  
sudo nano /etc/rancid/rancid.conf

*Find the term LIST_OF_GROUPS add the groups separated by space then exit and save* 
```
LIST_OF_GROUPS="core access"; export LIST_OF_GROUPS
```

### Verify the added groups

**baggy@plasma:~$**  
cat /etc/rancid/rancid.conf  | egrep -i "list.*group"

```
# LIST_OF_GROUPS (below).  In addition to these, there will be a "CVS"
# list of rancid groups
LIST_OF_GROUPS="core access"; export LIST_OF_GROUPS
#LIST_OF_GROUPS="$LIST_OF_GROUPS noc billybobisp"; export LIST_OF_GROUPS
```
