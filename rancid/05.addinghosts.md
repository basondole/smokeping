# Adding Hosts
The ```router.db``` file is specific for each group and located in the group directory.  
Note even if the devices are not routers they will be added in the ```router.db``` for that group.  
Add devices to the group by editing the ```/var/lib/rancid/core/router.db``` and ```/var/lib/rancid/access/router.db```

**rancid@plasma:~$**  
nano /var/lib/rancid/core/router.db  
*add your devices in the below format then save and exit*
```
hostname1:cisco:up  
192.168.56.36:juniper:up
```

If you use hostname, the hostnames however must be defined in the ```etc/hosts``` file.  
To add a host name, hostname1, with an IP address 192.168.56.57 for example, edit the ```/etc/hosts``` and add

**rancid@plasma:~$**
nano /etc/hosts  
```
192.168.56.57 hostname1
```
