# CVS Setup
By default RANCID uses CVS to keep track of changes to your devices.  
To prepare the CVS database you have to run the command rancid-cvs as the rancid user.  
This needs to be done each time you add a new group to the /etc/rancid/rancid.conf  

**baggy@plasma:~$**  
sudo -i -u rancid /var/lib/rancid/bin/rancid-cvs  

This will create a directory for each group in ```/var/lib/rancid```  
Therefore the core group will be located in the directory ```/var/lib/rancid/core```  
The access group will be located in the directory ```/var/lib/rancid/access directory```
