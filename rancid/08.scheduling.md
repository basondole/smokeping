# Scheduling

In order for RANCID to keep track of changes you have to schedule a cronjob with will run as the rancid user.

**rancid@plasma:~$**  
crontab -e  
*Add the line then save and exit*  
```0 * * * * * /usr/bin/rancid-run```

This will schedule a run each hour and notify the members of the respective group each time any of the devices change.  
You can of course set it to run how often you like depending on your needs.
