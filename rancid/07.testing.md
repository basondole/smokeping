Once the authentication has been setup you can try to login to one of the devices using the rancid user.  
rancid user has to be created in the respective routers and switches.  
Loging into cisco devices is done by the clogin command located in ```/var/lib/rancid/bin```  
Also in that directory you will notice other *login files  
For example ```clogin``` is for Cisco ```hlogin``` is for HP devices and ```flogin``` is for Foundry and ```jlogin``` is for juniper devices

To test juniper login  
**baggy@plasma:~$**  
jlogin 192.168.56.57  

To test cisco login  
**baggy@plasma:~$**  
clogin 192.168.56.36
