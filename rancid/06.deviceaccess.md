# Device Access
Credential to access the devices is stored in the ```.cloginrc``` file  
You have to create it manually in the rancid users home directory ```/var/lib/rancid```   

**rancid@plasma:~$**    
cd /var/lib/rancid    
nano .cloginrc  
*add below lines then save and exit*  
```
  add autoenable * 1
  add method * ssh
  add user * rancid
  add password * rancidpassword
```

This will tell RANCID to login to all devices (*) with SSH.  
To login with the username rancid and password rancid password to all devices.  
The autoenable line tells RANCID that the devices are configured to place the rancid user in enabled mode directly after login.  
You must also change the permission to the file in order to lock it down to avoid unauthorised accessto the ```.clogin``` file  

**rancid@plasma:~$**  
chmod 600 .cloginrc	

Change the permission and ownership of rancid directories  
**rancid@plasma:~$**  
chown â€“R rancid:rancid /var/lib/rancid   
chown -R rancid:rancid /var/log/rancid
