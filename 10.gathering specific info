# you can also use the login program to for more specific tasks.
# you can tell RANCID to login to a specific device and run one command.

baggy@plasma:~$ jlogin -c "show system users" 192.168.56.57

# would login to the 192.168.56.57 router and execute the show system users command and then logout of the router.
# This in itself might not save you that much time, but perhaps you want to run a command several times over a period of time.
# Then you can schedule a command like this to collect information.
# Or you can run the command against all your routers.

# another parameter you can use with the login command is -x.
# It works like -c but instead of typing in the commands you want to execute you store them in a separate file.

baggy@plasma:~$ clogin -x commands.txt 192.168.57.56

# the above command would login to the IP 192.168.56.57 and execute all the commands you have entered in the commands.txt file. 

baggy@plasma:~$ clogin -x commands.txt `cat switches.txt`

# the above command would login to the each IP from the file switches.txt 
# and execute all the commands you have entered in the commands.txt file.
