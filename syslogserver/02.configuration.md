# Configuration of syslog server  

The default configuration file is `/etc/rsyslog.conf`  

Edit the configuration file to allow remote device to send logs to the server

`sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf`  

Add below lines if they are missing or uncomment if they are commented
```
module(load="imudp")
 input(type="imudp" port="514")

module(load="imtcp")
 input(type="imtcp" port="514")
```

This will cause the syslog messages sent by remote systems to be recorded in the default syslog file `/var/log/syslog`  
We can give a directive to direct the logs to a different directory instead as defined below
```
$template remote-incoming logs,"/var/log/%HOSTNAME%/%PROGRAMNAME%.log"
 *.* ?remote-incoming-logs
 & ~
```

Note: This template affects the local logs for this server too. While using this template the logs will be recorded in  
`/var/log/device-hostname/program-generating-the-log.log`

Thus each device will have a separate directory. Save the config file and restart the service  
`sudo service rsyslog restart`
